# Lottery Game and Winning Numbers Generator

Written in Python

Choose from 4 different lottery games:
	
	Pick 3
	Pick 6

This game requires user input. The user is asked to pick which game they'd like to play. Then, they are prompted to choose numbers based on the rules of the game they've chosen. For example, for Pick 3, they are asked to choose 3 numbers ranging from 0-9. Then, these numbers are compared to the winning set of numbers, which are generated automatically. If they match, the user wins!
